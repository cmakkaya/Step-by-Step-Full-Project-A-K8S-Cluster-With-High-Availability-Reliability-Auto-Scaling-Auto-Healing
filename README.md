# 1- Kubernetes Deployment:

## 1.1. Creating a VPC in AWS with both public and private subnets.

### 1.1.1. Creating VPC for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) by Using Cloudformation:
* The yaml installation file for Cloudformation is available in this GitHub repo. You can download the CloudFormation template from the GitHub repo.
* Note: AWS recommends installing with AWS Cloudformation.
* For a more detailed explanation, you can review [this documantation's link.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.html) 
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/feb5e118-6a51-43d1-9d32-9d8430bca87f)
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/bab0a3f5-f72e-4cf5-93ab-6747871e18d0)
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/9dbdea99-c535-42e6-89ea-a1424f17965b)

Or
Also, If you want, we can create a VPC for EKS with AWS Cloudformation using "Cloudformation's Amazon S3 URL to create VPC for Amazon EKS (AWS CloudFormation template)" instead of using "Cloudformation yaml installation file".
We can create a VPC that supports only IPv4, or a VPC that supports IPv4 and IPv6. To do this, paste one of the following URLs into the text area under "Amazon S3 URL" and choose "Next", as shown in the pictures below.

```bash
for IPv4:
https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/cloudformation/2020-10-29/amazon-eks-vpc-private-subnets.yaml

for IPv4 and IPv6:
https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/cloudformation/2020-10-29/amazon-eks-ipv6-vpc-public-private-subnets.yaml
```

### 1.1.2. Creating VPC for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) by Using Terraform
* The terraform-vpc installation's `.tf files` are available in this GitHub repo. The files that create the Amazon EKS cluster also create a VPC for Amazon EKS.
* For a more detailed explanation, you can review [this documantation's link.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) 
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/81b61e97-ceed-415e-91ef-8ff4856ea50e)

####  Goto "terraform-eks-and-vpc" folder and run the following commands:
```bash
terraform init
```
####  Apply the infrastructure:
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## 1.2. Deploying a Kubernetes cluster in AWS using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) in the private subnet.

### 1.2.1. Firstly, create a role for Amazon EKS:
* Kubernetes clusters managed by Amazon EKS use this role to manage nodes and the legacy Cloud Provider uses this role to create load balancers with Elastic Load Balancing for services. Before you create Amazon EKS clusters, you must create an IAM role with either of the following IAM policies.
* For a more detailed explanation, you can review [this documantation's link.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html)
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/b697a4f9-680c-4da0-a36b-c4fe6b650c25)

## 3- AWS Integration:

### Integrate an Amazon RDS instance for database storage and Implement AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) used by the application.
### NOTE: For the application to work properly, it must work with the Database, so this section was done in items 1.2. and 1.3.

## 4- Scaling and Auto-Healing:

## 4.1.  Implementing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for one or more components of your sample application.
## 4.1.1. Creating the HorizontalPodAutoscaler
For a more detailed explanation, you can review my article in the link, [Diving into Kubernetes-1: Creating and Testing a Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) in Kubernetes Cluster](https://cmakkaya.medium.com/kubernetes-creating-and-testing-a-horizontal-pod-autoscaling-hpa-in-kubernetes-cluster-548f2378f0c3#ff68)

## 4.2. Configuring the Kubernetes cluster for automatic scaling based on resource utilization.

## 4.2.1. Deploying Cluster Autoscaler
* For a more detailed explanation, you can review [this documantation's link.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/autoscaling.html) 
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/6a20350b-7612-4448-b63a-f66832970422)

## 4.2.2. Configuring Dynamic scaling policies via AWS Console
![image](https://github.com/cmakkaya/Step-by-Step-Full-Project-A-K8S-Cluster-With-High-Availability-Reliability-Auto-Scaling-Auto-Healing/assets/110052470/532d9d0f-84c0-49c0-9831-212e8cdcb961)

## 4.3. Multi-AZ Kubernetes Cluster for Reliability
It provides high availability by distributing the EKS cluster across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs), thus it increases "Reliability". 
#### Note: I did not apply this option during installation to reduce costs.

## 4.4. High Availability, Auto Scaling, Auto-Healing, and Failover for RDS DataBase
* Multi-AZ cluster for High Availability and failover. To get high availability and enhance availability during planned system maintenance, and help protect databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption.
* Point time recovery for AutoBackup, 
* ElastiCache cluster (to save up to 55% in cost and gain up to 80x faster read performance using ElastiCache with RDS for MySQL).
* Enabled Storage Auto Scaling
* Read replica to increase the scalability for high performance.  I did not implement this, However, I could use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for my production RDS database. Also, Read Replicas helps in decreasing load on the primary DB by serving read-only traffic.
#### NOTE: This section was done in item 1.3.

## 4.5. Caching for Microservice Applications by using Amazon CloudFront
#### Thus, it helps reduce the load on the originating server (the web server from which CloudFront retrieves the content) and improves content delivery performance. It also improves the usability of our website, providing higher usability.
#### We also protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that affect the availability of a website.

## 5- Monitoring and Logging:

## 5.1. Integrate AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging of the Kubernetes cluster and the deployed application.
I can enable CloudWatch Observability in our clusters through the CloudWatch Observability add-on. After my cluster is created, navigate to the add-ons tab and install the CloudWatch Observability add-on to enable CloudWatch Application Signals and Container Insights and start ingesting telemetry into CloudWatch.

## 5.1.1. Enabling Control plane logging 
```bash
eksctl utils update-cluster-logging --enable-types={ all } --region=us-east-1 --cluster=cumhur-eks-cluster
```
